title: AI Security Introduction

HipoCap Shield provides **runtime protection** for your AI applications, intercepting and blocking prompt injection attacks, sensitive keyword exposure, and unauthorized function access *before* they reach the LLM or the user.

Stop analyzing what went wrong. Prevent it from happening.

## What is the Hipocap Shield?

The HipoCap Shield is the **Enforcement Layer** that sits between your AI application and function calls. Unlike traditional observability tools that analyze events after they occur, the Shield actively intercepts and blocks threats in real-time. It analyzes every function call request through three stages of security analysis before allowing execution, ensuring threats never reach your models or users.

## Threat Categories

Hipocap detects threats across 14 categories (S1-S14):

- **S1**: Violent Crimes
- **S2**: Non-Violent Crimes
- **S3**: Sex-Related Crimes
- **S4**: Child Sexual Exploitation
- **S5**: Defamation
- **S6**: Specialized Advice (medical, legal, financial)
- **S7**: Privacy Violations
- **S8**: Intellectual Property Violations
- **S9**: Indiscriminate Weapons
- **S10**: Hate Speech
- **S11**: Suicide & Self-Harm
- **S12**: Sexual Content
- **S13**: Election Manipulation
- **S14**: Code Interpreter Abuse

## Multi-Stage Analysis

### Stage 1: Input Analysis
Uses Prompt Guard to detect malicious patterns in function inputs before execution.

### Stage 2: LLM Analysis
Analyzes function results for threat indicators, attack patterns, and function call attempts.

### Stage 3: Quarantine Analysis
Simulates infection by sending content to a quarantine LLM, then analyzes the output for hidden instructions.

## Key Features

- **Runtime Protection** - Intercepts and blocks threats *before* they reach the LLM or user, not after
- **Prompt Injection Protection** - Detects and blocks indirect prompt injection attacks in real-time
- **Keyword Detection** - Identifies and protects sensitive keywords and patterns before they're exposed
- **Function Call Detection** - Detects unauthorized function call attempts embedded in content and blocks execution
- **Keyword Detection** - Customizable keyword detection for sensitive patterns
- **Real-time Analysis** - Fast analysis with configurable quick mode for low-latency requirements—security checks don't slow down your agents

## How It Works

1. Function call is intercepted by Hipocap Shield
2. Multi-stage analysis runs (Input → LLM → Quarantine)
3. RBAC and governance rules are checked
4. Decision is made: ALLOW or BLOCK
5. All activity is traced and logged for observability
