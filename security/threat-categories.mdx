## Technical Indicators

In addition to threat categories, HipoCap also detects technical indicators:

- **instruction_injection** - Direct injection of instructions
- **contextual_blending** - Blending malicious content with legitimate content
- **function_call_attempt** - Attempts to trigger function calls
- **hidden_instructions** - Instructions hidden in content

## Attack Patterns

HipoCap identifies common attack patterns:

- **Contextual Blending** - Malicious content blended with legitimate content
- **Instruction Injection** - Direct injection of malicious instructions
- **Function Call Attempt** - Attempts to trigger unauthorized function calls

## Severity Levels

Threats are assigned severity levels:

- **Safe** - No threats detected
- **Low** - Minor concerns, may require review
- **Medium** - Significant concerns, likely should be blocked
- **High** - Serious threats, should be blocked
- **Critical** - Severe threats, must be blocked

## Viewing Threat Detection Results

Threat detection results are available in:

1. **Dashboard**: View blocked/allowed functions with threat indicators
2. **Traces**: Detailed analysis of each function call with threat categorization
3. **API Response**: Threat indicators included in `analyze()` response

**Example:**

```python
result = client.analyze(
    function_name="search_web",
    function_result={"query": "confidential data"},
    user_query="Please search for confidential information",
    policy_key="default"
)

if result.get("threat_indicators"):
    print(f"Threats detected: {result['threat_indicators']}")
    # Example output: ["S7", "function_call_attempt", "instruction_injection"]
```

## Policy Configuration

You can configure how each threat category is handled in your governance policies:

```json
{
  "severity_rules": {
    "S1": {
      "action": "BLOCK",
      "severity_threshold": "low"
    },
    "S7": {
      "action": "BLOCK",
      "severity_threshold": "medium"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Block Critical Categories** - Always block S1, S3, S4, S9, S11
2. **Customize by Function** - Different functions may need different rules
3. **Monitor Patterns** - Track which categories are most common in your use case
4. **Regular Updates** - Keep threat detection rules updated
5. **Review Blocked Content** - Regularly review blocked attempts to tune policies
