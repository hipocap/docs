# What is HipoCap?

HipoCap is the first **DevSecOps platform designed specifically for AI Agents**.

While traditional observability tools tell you *after* an LLM has hallucinated or leaked sensitive information, HipoCap sits between your model and your data to enforce security policies in real-time.

Built on the high-performance observability core of [Laminar AI](https://www.lmnr.ai/), HipoCap extends standard tracing with a **Security Shield** and **Function-Level RBAC**, allowing enterprises to move agents from prototype to production without risking compliance violations.

## Why HipoCap?

AI Agents are non-deterministic—they can be tricked, injected, or simply make mistakes. HipoCap provides the guardrails necessary to trust them with real data.

    **Least Privilege.** Ensure your "Support Agent" can read emails but never delete databases. Define strict permissions for every tool call.
